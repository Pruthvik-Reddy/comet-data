COMET is used to get ATOMIC/CONCEPTNET Inferences. 

A metaphorical sentence has a ver and an argument associated with it. In the paper "Its Not Rocket Science : 
Interpreting Figurative Language in Narratives" by Chakrabarty et al., they proposed that adding those 
inferences to the sentences might help in giving some interpretation. 

For the MOH-X_formatted_svo_cleaned file, we explicitly have "arg" and "verb" in the file. So extracted inferences 
for it and divided them into ten files to suit MELBERT. The data is under "test_inferences" and "COMET_Inferences_MOH-X_data.csv"

For MOH-X_formatted_svo_cleabed, analyze the POS of the data in the file "POS_MOH_X". Use it to draw "arg"
 for VUA_verb data.
